This Project is about implementing Machine Learning Algorithms to leverage some insights about Football Players

This Project uses the final database.
1) Building the database - 4 Steps:
- Collecting the EA Sports FIFA 19 Game Statistics of Football Players
- Web-Scraping the corresponding information on Transfermarkt website
- Web-Scraping the performances on ESPN FC website
- Web-Scraping the Instagram and Facebook followers for assessing the Marketing impact

2) Cleaning the dataset - 3 Steps:
- Completing the missing values with players of similar characteristics
- Correcting outliers for instagram followers (small players confounded with very famous influencer)
- Removing players with a small amount of data


There are 3 parts on this project:
- Understanding the factors explaining the Market Value of a Player
- Spotting the outstanding players (in terms of performances) over a season
- For a Club: decide the best replacement for a transfered player
